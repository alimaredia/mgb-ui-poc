Mass General Brigham ('MGB'), its Affiliated Institutions, their leadership, and their individuals have a long history of supporting collaborations with Industry and other Outside Entities.  Preserving these relationships is essential because they advance MGB's mission of providing, promoting, and supporting high quality and leading edge patient care, research, and medical education.

At the same time, MGB recognizes that conflicts of interest, and the appearance of conflict of interest, may arise from these interactions. These conflicts create a risk that integrity, independence, leadership, exercise of professional judgment, or the reputation of MGB may be compromised. However, in most cases these risks are manageable and the relationships are encouraged and allowed because of their importance to the advancement of MGB's mission.

Interactions with Industry and other Outside Entities also have the potential to create conflicts of commitment, in that Outside Activities or Financial Interests may deter individuals from devoting an appropriate amount of time, energy, creativity, or other personal resources to their MGB responsibilities. Here too, these risks are generally manageable and do not prevent relationships from going forward.

To assure that these relationships are reviewed consistently with these values, MGB has adopted this Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities to evaluate and appropriately address these relationships.

Note : The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Except for Section 1.2.3, terms in this Policy that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.  Italicized terms in Section 1.2.3 shall have the meaning specified in the HMS Conflicts Policy.

## P.1. Purpose of the Policy, Continued

## P.1.2 Definition Of Conflict Of Interest

For purposes of this Policy, a 'conflict of interest' refers in general to 'a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest' (Institute of Medicine, 2009).

These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · Those where outside financial or other interests may inappropriately influence the way the individual carries out his or her MGB responsibilities, or
- · Those where an individual's outside interests may be adverse to MGB, or
- · Those where an individual has the opportunity to use his or her MGB position for personal financial gain.

The determination of the existence of a conflict of interest, according to the standards specified above, is based on an evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances by the decision-making entity designated in this Policy for that particular context, as may be more specifically detailed in this Policy.

## P.1.3 Purpose The purpose of the Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities is to

- · Maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in all MGB activities and affairs
- · Support principled relationships with Industry and other Outside Entities that advance patient care, research, and medical education consistent with these standards, and
- · Preserve public confidence that these standards are and will be maintained.

## Obligation of Researchers to Disclose Certain Financial Interests

In addition to any disclosure requirement of the publisher, a Researcher who is publishing, formally presenting research results, or providing expert commentary on a subject must simultaneously disclose any Financial Interest in an Outside Entity that owns or has a contractual right to the technology being reported or discussed or that sponsors the research being reported or discussed.

## Disclosure to Subjects in Human Subjects Research

The existence of all material financial interests of institutions and researchers in a human research study that are related to the research being performed shall be disclosed to the subjects in the study. Standards for "material" and "related" shall be established by the COA, guided by the Public Health Service regulations.

The precise wording of disclosure in the consent form should be determined by the IRB, but should include an explanation of the fact that the financial interest in question has been reviewed and the research allowed to go forward by the IRB.

At a minimum, the document or statement by which disclosure is made must include a clear reference to the presence of the financial interest, an indication that additional information is available regarding the details of the financial interest and how it is being addressed, and how that information can be readily obtained by those to whom the disclosure is made.

## Required Additional Measures

## Section 2 Clinical Care and Interactions with Industry

## 2.1. Policy Overview

## 2.1.1 Policy

Collaborations between MGB Individuals providing patient care and Industry present unique opportunities to improve and advance patient care.  However, these collaborations must be carefully managed to avoid improper influence and inducements in clinical care.  MGB encourages such collaborations, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.

MGB Individuals subject to this Section 2 are responsible for compliance with this Section.

Note: The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 2 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

A clinical conflict of interest may exist when a MGB Individual covered by this Section 2 has a personal Financial Interest or Outside Activity with a manufacturer of a drug, device, or other products for use in patient care, according to thresholds that may be established from time to time by COA, which could influence or be perceived as influencing his/her clinical decisionmaking or interactions with his/her patients.

A clinical conflict of interest may arise when MGB receives royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug, device, or other technology and, under institutional royalty-sharing policies, a MGB Individual subject to this Section 2 shares in those royalties according to thresholds that may be established from time to time by COA and uses the drug, device, or other technology in his/her clinical practice at MGB.

## 2.1.3 Ancillary Equipment

Conflicts of interest that may arise in connection with the purchase of ancillary equipment (e.g., equipment whose use does not require active selection by a MGB Individual as part of a specific clinical procedure, such as standard hospital equipment like scissors, sutures, and skin staples) for use at MGB patient care facilities are addressed in Section 5 of this Policy. Accordingly, this Section 2 does not address the use of ancillary equipment, even though the equipment may be utilized during a patient's medical treatment.

## 2.1.4 To Whom the Policy Applies

Section 2 applies to any MGB Individual who is a licensed caregiver and who, in the course and scope of his/her MGB responsibilities, provides to patients the care for which he/she is licensed.

- · Corroboration through a disinterested process of any prescription involving a product or device of a Company in which the clinical conflict of interest exists;
- · Review of practice patterns;
- · Reduction or elimination of the conflict; and
- · Transfer of clinical care to an alternate clinician.

COA may determine in particular cases that clinical conflicts of interest, according to thresholds established by COA, warrant individualized patient disclosure before a MGB Individual covered by this Section 2 prescribes or uses that Company's medical device, pharmaceutical, or medical care-related product in connection with the care of his/her individual patients.

License agreements under which MGB technology is licensed to a Company must state, as an exception to any requirement that the Company pay royalties to MGB, that the Company will not pay royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug or device to MGB, unless COA approves an arrangement under which all such royalties will be donated to a specific non-MGB charitable organization.

## 3.1.2 Description of Industry Support of Education

## Section 3 Industry Support Related to Education

## 3.1 Policy Overview

## 3.1.1 Rationale and Policy Statement

Industry support for MGB Educational Activities helps to further MGB ability to carry out its educational mission.  However, these situations need to be carefully managed to ensure that such support does not introduce bias into the content of MGB Educational Activities.  MGB encourages such support, subject to the requirements of this Section 3.

All MGB Educational Activities supported by Industry must comply with the policy requirements imposed by the Education Review Board (ERB), as described in more detail in this Section 3.

Note :  The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 3 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

Note : These policy requirements do not cover the participation of MGB Individuals in Industry-funded external educational activities not put on or sponsored by MGB.  Such activities are covered by Section 4 Consulting and Other Outside Activities , and Section 6 Gifts , below.

Industry support may be provided through:

- · Monetary support, or
- · In-kind support.

These two types of support may be directed to a specific MGB Educational Activity so long as such support is accepted in compliance with Section 3.3. Additionally, monetary support may be directed to a President's Fund for Medical Education so long as such support is accepted in compliance with Section 3.4.

3.1.4 OII Review of Industry Support

- · Clinical training programs, such as residencies and fellowship programs that involve a significant component consisting of direct patient care;
- · Educational events, including continuing medical education programs or other professional health care education programs that involve conferences or lectures or other forms of verbal presentations, regardless of whether the participants receive credit;
- · Educational tools and resources, including MGB newsletters and web sites designed to distribute educational information to healthcare practitioners, patients, and the public, even if such information pertains to research;
- · Educational service arrangements, whereby an Industry entity seeks to have a MGB hospital provide a training or educational program for its employees or other physicians with a specified focus or content (these may include observerships, preceptorships, and other similar arrangements); and
- · Other educational programs that are put on, or sponsored, by any MGB entity.

All Industry support for MGB Educational Activities must be reviewed by the MGB Office for Interactions with Industry (OII).

OII works with the ERB, as appropriate, to ensure compliance with MGB policies and procedures.

## 3.2.3 ERB Review of MGB Educational Activities

Subject to the reserved authority of PICC as referenced in Section P.2.3, the Education Review Board (ERB) has the authority to implement and enforce the MGB policy requirements for this section of the Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities , including the authority to:

- · Review and approve any Industry support, whether made directly or indirectly through intermediaries;
- Determine appropriate conditions for Industry support;
- Monitor and enforce compliance pertaining to Industry support of MGB Educational Activities; and
- · Make exceptions both in particular cases and to general policy requirements.

The ERB may delegate specific responsibilities to other institutional committees, offices, or individuals.

The ERB must review and approve all support from Industry for any MGB Educational Activity.

The ERB has the authority to determine the conditions or restrictions for receipt of in-kind Support.

If other institutional approval is required, such approval is required prior to the ERB's review.  For example, all clinical fellowships must be approved by the MGB Education Committee (PEC) prior to ERB review.

In addition to the requirements the ERB sets for Industry support of MGB Educational Activities, the ERB reviews the contractual documentation, budget, and Financial Interests related to all MGB Educational Activities supported by Industry.  Additionally, the ERB may review the content of any MGB Educational Activity supported by Industry.

## 3.3. Policy Requirements for Industry Support of MGB Educational Activities

## 3.3.1 Overview

All MGB Educational Activities with Industry support are subject to the following requirements as well as any additional requirements as deemed appropriate by the Education Review Board (ERB).

3.3.2 Compliance with Continuing Medical or Other Healthcare Professional Education Standards

## 3.3.3 Control of Content

3.3.4 Multiple Sources of Monetary Support Required

## 3.3.5

Review and Resolution of Financial Interests

All MGB Educational Activities with Industry support for which medical or other healthcare professional educational credit is offered through an accredited provider (whether CME or other credit) must comply with the standards for accreditation in the respective professional field.

All MGB Educational Activities with Industry support for which professional medical or other healthcare education credit is not offered must still meet the Industry-support standards for accreditation in the respective professional field (e.g., a program designed for physicians must meet ACCME Standards for Commercial Support, a program designed for nurses must meet the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation standards).  For programs in fields for which there are no such standards, standards will apply as established by the ERB.

Industry may not control the selection of speakers or content of the MGB Educational Activity.

Industry support for a specific MGB Educational Activity must come from more than one Industry entity, in accordance with conditions imposed by the ERB and subject to exceptions granted by the ERB.  Generally, no one Industry entity can provide more than 70% of the total commercial support.

All program/course directors, speakers, moderators, panelists, others as determined by the ERB must report their Financial Interests and Outside Activities that are related to the MGB Educational Activity, as required on any applicable forms or other disclosure processes, and must be resolved by ERB prior to the educational activity start date.

## 4.2.3 Prohibited Outside Activities

Consulting and other Outside Activities undertaken by MGB Individuals are encouraged and in most cases allowable according to the provisions of this Section 4.  These provisions establish oversight requirements and minimize the possibility of inappropriate considerations affecting the exercise of MGB responsibilities.  However, for a limited variety of Outside Activities, the potential for negative impact on the integrity of MGB missions is high, and accordingly, certain Outside Activities are prohibited.

## A.  Certain Company or Other Outside Entity Speaking and Training Engagements

Many speaking and training engagements for Companies or Other Outside Entities are encouraged, including CME presentations sponsored by accredited CME providers.  However, other engagements may compromise the independence and the reputation of the speaker and of MGB to such an extent that they are not allowed.  These engagements are described below.

Neither a Covered Individual, nor any other MGB Individual who is Acting in a MGB Capacity (except outside Trustees, Directors, and committee members),  may participate in:

- · Any arrangement or speaking engagement that is termed a 'Speakers Bureau'; or
- · Any speaking engagement for which a Company or Other Outside Entity has the contractual right to control what the individual says or otherwise has the final right of approval for content and edits of the individual's presentation materials; or
- · Any arrangement between an individual and a Company or Other Outside Entity
- o under which an agreement indicates that the speaker's name will be on a list of speakers or potential speakers; or
- o under which the individual will be engaged in promotional activity for the Company or Other Outside Entity; or
- · Any other exceptional circumstances as determined by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest (COA), including but not limited to excessive frequency of, or excessive compensation for, speaking engagements.

Supervisors have the right to review any and all Outside Activities, whether or not covered by a Written Agreement, of Covered Individuals who report to them.

Supervisors have the right and authority to disapprove any Outside Activity if, in the supervisor's judgment, the amount of time, compensation, or other factors would interfere with the Covered Individual's MGB responsibilities.

In reviewing and deciding whether to approve an Outside Activity, supervisors may take into account any relevant factors, including the Covered Individual's:

- · Level of seniority
- · Authority, and
- · Administrative responsibilities.

For example, supervisors may limit the amount of time devoted to Outside Activities or the amount of compensation received.

If a supervisor has a personal Financial Interest above thresholds established by COA in a matter for which he or she has supervisory responsibility pursuant to this Section 4, the supervisor must recuse himself or herself from acting on the matter and shall refer the matter to his or her supervisor.

If any issue reviewed by a supervisor is not resolved in the normal course of business, the COA has the authority to resolve the issue.

- · A Covered Individual may use the name of a MGB entity (in connection with an Outside Activity) to identify the Individual's position or title at MGB, so long as the use, in the judgment of COA, does not imply MGB endorsement or responsibility for the Outside Activity, the Outside Entity, or the Outside Entity's product or services, unless otherwise restricted by COA.

Written Agreements:

- · Should clearly specify all of the services, including scope and field of those services, to be provided by the Covered Individual, and

Collaborations among MGB, MGB Individuals, and Industry provide opportunities for productive collaboration and foster the exchange of knowledge and information that leads to advances in science and patient care. However, MGB Financial Interests in Industry, including Financial Interests of Institutional Officials and other supervisory personnel, may result in inappropriate influence, or the appearance of inappropriate influence, on MGB charitable activities.  MGB requires that these Interests receive special review and oversight, as described in this Section 5.

Note :  The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 5 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

## 5.2. Policy Requirements for Certain Institutional Financial Interests

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments

Sometimes MGB acquires equity (stock, stock options, or similar ownership interests) outside the normal Treasury investment and Development Office acquisition processes.  In most cases this happens as a result of a license of institutional technology or investments relating to technology or start-up Company activities.  Such equity is referred to here as 'Special Equity.'

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB holds Special Equity in a Company and conducts Clinical Research on or clinical validation of technology of that Company.

Accordingly, MGB adopts a rebuttable presumption that a MGB Affiliated Institution may not conduct Clinical Research on the technology of a Company, or validate or test on patients the unvalidated technology of a Company, (collectively referred to in this Section 5.2.1 as Clinical Research/Validation) if it or any other MGB Affiliated Institution simultaneously holds Special Equity in the Company.

The presumption may be overcome only if:

- (a) COA determines that there are demonstrable, compelling circumstances, consistent with the rights and welfare of clinical research subjects, for the MGB Affiliated Institution conducting the Clinical Research/Validation while it or any other MGB institution holds special equity; OR
- (b) COA determines that the Clinical Research/Validation will be conducted at a different MGB Affiliated Institution from the one that owns or stands to benefit financially from the equity, and that individuals at the Affiliated Institution that owns or stands to benefit from the equity have no significant supervisory or other authority over the Researchers in the Clinical Research/Validation; OR
- (c) COA determines that the benefits of the MGB Affiliated Institution conducting the Clinical Research/Validation outweigh the risks, and the Clinical Research/Validation has been determined by the IRB to present no more than minimal risk to the subjects participating in it.

## 5.2. Policy Requirements for Certain Institutional Financial

Interests, Continued

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments Continued

If the presumption is overcome under (a), (b), or (c), the Clinical Research/Validation may proceed only if COA determines that the equity holding can be appropriately managed, pursuant to a COA-approved management plan directed at protection of the integrity of the Clinical Research/Validation and the human subjects participating in it.  PICC shall have the authority to review any decision by COA pursuant to this Section5.2.1 that has significant financial implications for MGB.

For purposes of this section 5.2.1, Clinical Research/ Validation shall not include research that is determined by the Institutional Review Board and/ or COA to be Nominal Risk Clinical Research. Such Nominal Risk Clinical Research/ Validation is not subject to the rebuttable presumption above, but may proceed only pursuant to a management plan approved by COA, which authority is delegable by COA to OII.

Factors that may be relevant to the analysis of whether compelling circumstances exist for the Clinical Research/Validation include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · The nature of the science involved;
- · A description of the institutional financial interest and how closely it is linked to the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · The degree to which the interest may be affected by the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · The magnitude of the potential risks to subjects or integrity inherent in the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · How those risks could be affected as a result of the institutional financial interest;
- · Whether the MGB Affiliated Institution is uniquely qualified, by virtue of its attributes (e.g. special facilities or equipment, unique patient population) and its researchers, to conduct the Clinical Research/Validation; or
- · The degree to which the institutional conflict of interest can be effectively managed.

Interests, Continued

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments Continued

Possible elements of associated management plans may include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · Special oversight of human subjects involved in the Clinical Research/Validation, for example, through additional internal monitoring mechanisms or through an external IRB or DSMB;
- · Increasing or establishing firewalls or other conflicts management systems to separate financial decision-making from decision-making about the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · Independent data monitoring to ensure validity, through an objective individual or individuals outside the MGB Affiliated Institution with no ties to the Clinical Research/Validation or to the outside entity;
- · Disclosure of institutional conflicts as defined in this Section 5 in all relevant settings, including to human subjects involved in the Clinical Research/Validation; or
- · Modification or restriction of the MGB Affiliated Institution's financial interest, through lock-up provisions, divestiture, or the like.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when a MGB Affiliated Institution receives or has the potential to receive significant license payments from the sale of technology that is the subject of Clinical Research conducted at that Institution.  These license payments include, but are not limited to:

- · Upfront payments
- · Milestone payments, and
- · Royalties.

## Requirement for COA Review and Approval

When OII determines that a MGB Affiliated Institution proposes to conduct Clinical Research on the technology of a Company that is subject to a license or option to license from that Institution and that Institution is receiving license payments, above a threshold established by COA, from the sale of that technology, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at that Institution.  In performing its analysis, COA may take into account any factors that it deems relevant to the analysis.

## 5.2.3 Oversight of Major Gifts and Research

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when a MGB Affiliated Institution receives substantial gifts from a Company:

- · That sponsors Clinical Research at that Institution or
- · Whose technology is proposed to be studied or tested in Clinical Research at that Institution.

## Requirement for COA Review and Approval

When OII determines that a MGB Affiliated Institution proposes to conduct Clinical Research sponsored by, or on the technology of, a Company from which that Institution has received substantial gifts above thresholds established by the COA, including gifts in kind, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at that Institution.  In performing this analysis, COA may take into account any factors it deems relevant to the analysis.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB receives royalties derived from the sales of particular drugs or devices to MGB.

License agreements under which MGB technology is licensed by MGB to a Company must state that the Company will not pay royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug or device to MGB, unless the COA approves an arrangement under which all such royalties will be donated to a specific nonMGB charitable organization.

- · A fiduciary position in the Company; or
- · Annual compensation or other income from the Company above a threshold established by COA; or
- · Equity or other ownership interest in the Company, including stock options, above a threshold established by COA;

- · Whose technology is (or is proposed to be) the subject of research conducted by the supervisor's direct reports.

COA may impose restrictions on and implement management mechanisms for the supervisor with respect to oversight of such research.

- · Note:  A MGB Individual participating in research may request COA's review of a potential conflict of interest, as defined in this section, of his or her direct supervisor with respect to that research.  COA shall have the prerogative to decide whether the relationship merits management.
- · Direct supervisors of research may request OII or COA review of any potential conflict.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB enters or considers entering a transaction with any of the following:

- · A MGB Individual
- · A person who is a member of a MGB Individual's Family; or
- · An Outside Entity in which a MGB Individual or a member of his/her Family has a Financial Interest or relationship.

The requirements in this Section 5.5 are intended to ensure the integrity of decision-making in institutional transactions.

A MGB Individual, including an outside director or trustee, is deemed to be an Interested Individual for a particular transaction if he/she is a party to or aware that MGB is entering (or considering entering) into a transaction with:

- · A person who is a member of the MGB Individual's Family, or
- · An Outside Entity in which that MGB Individual or a member of his/her Family has either a Financial Interest or relationship that exceeds thresholds established by COA.

Except as stated below, a MGB Individual must not participate in discussions on or recommendations regarding, act upon, or otherwise participate in the decision-making regarding the transaction in which he/she is an Interested Individual.

- · Others involved in the discussion and/or recommendation are aware of the Financial Interest or relationship held by the Interested Individual, whether by disclosure by the Interested Individual or otherwise; and
- · The Interested Individual possesses particular expertise or knowledge that would be beneficial to the final decision.

Note: COA may determine additional exceptions to the recusal requirement of Section 5.5.3.

For any transaction that involves a contract to purchase Goods or Services exceeding thresholds established by COA (referred to in this section as a 'Reviewable Purchasing Transaction'), the following procedures must be completed prior to entering into the transaction.

When informed of a Reviewable Purchasing Transaction, OII shall determine from submitted MGB Annual Disclosure Statements whether a MGB Individual or member of his or her Family has a Financial Interest in or relationship with the Outside Entity involved in the transaction that exceeds thresholds established by COA.

- · If OII finds there is no such Financial Interest or relationship, this finding shall be documented in writing, and the transaction may be entered into.
- · If OII finds there is one or more such Financial Interests or relationships, the person responsible for the transaction must make a written determination that, notwithstanding the apparent conflict, the transaction is fair and reasonable to MGB and is in the best interest of MGB. The basis for this determination must include but is not limited to: The consideration of at least two alternative disinterested competitive proposals, or
- · A determination that two such competitive proposals do not exist or that it would be impractical to solicit them, along with an explanation for why it was determined appropriate to enter into the transaction without considering such competitive proposals.

## 6.1. Policy Overview

## 6.1.1 Policy on Gifts to MGB

Gifts to MGB or its Affiliated Institutions from pharmaceutical Companies, medical device Companies, and other vendors may provide valuable resources that help MGB to carry out its charitable activities. However, such gifts may raise concerns about inappropriate influence on MGB charitable missions. Therefore, they must be overseen by appropriate MGB officials.

Gifts to MGB from pharmaceutical Companies, medical device Companies, and other vendors and potential vendors for the support of MGB Educational Activities shall be handled by OII in accordance with Section 3 of this Policy. All other gifts are the responsibility of the relevant Institution's Development Office.

Note: The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 6 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

When gifts are made to or for the benefit of MGB Individuals, they have the potential to influence or create the appearance of influencing the behavior of MGB Individuals in carrying out their MGB responsibilities.

MGB Individuals may not accept any gifts (including meals and entertainment or funding for meals and entertainment), regardless of value, from pharmaceutical Companies, medical device Companies, or other vendors or potential vendors of MGB.

MGB and its Affiliated Institutions may not accept any gifts for the personal use or benefit of staff members (including meals and entertainment or funding for meals and entertainment), regardless of value, from pharmaceutical Companies, medical device Companies, or other vendors or potential vendors of MGB.
